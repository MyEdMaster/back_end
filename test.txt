When you divide two complex numbers, the numerator has the form a+bi and the denominator has the form c+di
a, b, c, and d are real numbers. They can be positive or negative. Often they are integers.
I is the square root of minus 1
When you divide two complex numbers, your primary goal is to rationalize the denominator.
To rationalize the denominator, you divide both numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.
The conjugate is the complex number with sign between real and imaginary part changed.
If the denominator is represented by the expression c+di, its conjugate is c-di.
Once you set up the problem to multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, you use FOIL to carry out the multiplication
FOIL stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last. It comes from the distributive property.
When you FOIL the numerator you get (ac-adi+bci-bdi^2) which equals ac-adi+bci+bd
When you FOIL the denominator you get (c^2-cdi+cdi-d^2i^2)” or “(c^-cdi+cdi+d^2)
After you have FOILed the numerator and denominator, you combine like terms.
After you combine like terms, you get ((ac+bd)+(bc-ad)i)/(c^2+d^2)
